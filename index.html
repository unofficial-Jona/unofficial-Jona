                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        Greetings! I'm Jonathan Aechtner, a recent graduate from Maastricht University with a Master's in Data Science for Decision Making. My drive is anchored in the belief that data, when processed and understood correctly, can unveil layers of insights about the world around us. Be it through the lens of computer vision or the nuances of natural language processing (NLP), the potential is vast and captivating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My academic foray into computer vision, exemplified by my thesis on "Assessing Aggressive Driving Behaviour Using Attention-Based Models," is a testament to my commitment to extracting meaning from visual data. Meanwhile, a semester in Aarhus, Denmark, introduced me to Augmented Reality, merging the real with the digital in exciting ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Professionally, my experience with a German healthcare consultancy honed my adaptability. While my primary task revolved around tabular data analytics, I also ventured into the world of NLP, implementing a chatbot that enhanced customer interactions. This blend of experiences has solidified my belief in the multifaceted applications of data science.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a personal note, the adaptability learned from snowboarding and the diverse viewpoints garnered from traveling have subtly influenced my professional approach. I believe in remaining flexible and open-minded, ready to dive into any domain of data science that promises innovation and progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I embark on this next phase, I'm eager to explore opportunities that not only deepen knowledge but also drive tangible change, irrespective of the specific domain within data science.
                    </p>
